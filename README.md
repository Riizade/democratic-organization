# democratic-organization
A repository containing the framework for a democratic revision of a labor organization

## What is this?
This repository is meant to represent the governance structure of an organization whose primary function is to participate in economic activity. That is, this repository defines the governance structure of a company with workers and products and revenues and profits and all of the things that come with running a company. This repository currently represents a theoretical structure for an organization that does not currently exist.

## Okay, why?

### Democracy is good
People all over the world have recognized that Democracy, for all its flaws, represents the best known way to govern large groups of individuals. Despite widely recognizing the benefits to members of societies which uphold the ideals of freedom, democratic participation, and transparency, and equally recognizing the flaws and dangers of autocracy and secrecy, most societies of the world have allowed that the basic unit of economic organization be entirely autocratic and authoritarian. 

### Employer control
Admittedly within some limits imposed by democratic governments, the employer you work for determines what you work on, how your work is used, how the profits of your labor are spent, and to a frightening degree how you live your life outside of your participation in producing useful output for them. The argument made by this document is that the current state of employment is wrong because it unnecessarily infringes upon the freedoms of people who participate in producing labor for an autocratic employer. Additionally, while individuals do have some degree of control over which employer they choose to work for, the reality is that the overwhelming majority of employers are autocratic and unnecessarily callous toward the concerns of their employees, and individuals' ability to choose an employer which respects their health and happiness is virtually nonexistent.

Below is a series of methods and contexts in which employers control and infringe upon their employees' basic freedoms.

#### Physical location
Despite much work being remote-friendly, employers overwhelmingly (although less so post-COVID-19) require that employees be present in a specific physical office space for set hours (typically 9am-5pm) for the majority of calendar days of of the year. Individuals are largely not free to work in one city but live in another 100 miles away. In this way, employers substantially control the region in which individuals live. Most laborers with remote-friendly jobs such as artists, software developers, and project managers will have overwhelming pressure to live in a major city regardless of their personal lifestyle preferences. Living anywhere else comes at a significant salary and career growth cost.
